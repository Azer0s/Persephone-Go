# Persephone-Go

A simple Persephone implementation in Go. 
This repository is the, de facto, reference implementation for the Persephone instruction set.
It is not incredibly fast or feature rich but it implements all Persephone language features.

## Usage

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Azer0s/Persephone-Go.git
$ cd Persephone-Go
$ make
$ make run/examples/fib.psph
```
